Introduction
************

The SW is based on
**STM32F0-Discovery**
and use the
**STM Library ver.1.0.0**

I developed the SW using
**KEIL C Compiler free version**
(
ver.4.60.0.0
) but I kept the structure of the STM library so is theoretically possible rebuild my project using:

Atollic, IAR and Tasking.


This SW is certainly not exhaustive but is intended to give you the basic functions to manage the STM WiFi module.

As improvements are recommended to implement error handling more in-depth than is currently implemented.
